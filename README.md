# I-CS-U1-1-E17

Repository for the course I-CS-U1-1-E17 at University of Southern Denmark

This repository will contain all code examples that I use throughout the course. Furthermore all presentations will be present as PDFs.

## Litterature

Some students have expressed the desire to get books for the course. I have no official book for the course, but I am able to recommend some solid books.

- C# in depth - Jon Skeet
  - This is really in depth and can be used as a reference book
- C# 6.0 in a nutshell
- C# 6 for programmers
- C# 6.0 Cookbook: Solutions for C# Developers

Also look at the [medium post](https://medium.com/level-up-web/best-c-books-in-2017-f0532502d34c) for inspiration and information.
