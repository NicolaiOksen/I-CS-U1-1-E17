## Exercise 1

Lets try Test Driven Development (TDD)

1. Create a new solution
1. Create a Console App project, called “Calculator”
1. Create a Test project, called “CalculatorTests”
1. Implement following methods
    - Add
    - Subtract
    - Multiply
    - Divide

Start by writing required tests for a given method, then implementing the method.

Tests should verify that methods works as intended. I.e. `1 + 1 = 2`

Execute tests after each code change.
